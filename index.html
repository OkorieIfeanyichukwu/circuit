	<h2>Distributed-element circuit</h2>
	<hr>
	<br>

	<strong>Distributed-element circuits</strong> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_circuit" target="_blank">electrical circuits</a> composed of lengths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line" target="_blank">transmission lines</a> or other distributed components. These circuits perform the same functions as conventional circuits composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivity_(engineering)" target="_blank">passive</a> components, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capacitor" target="_blank">capacitors</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor" target="_blank"> inductors</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer" target="_blank">transformers</a>. They are used mostly at microwave frequencies, where conventional components are difficult (or impossible) to implement.

	Conventional circuits consist of individual components manufactured separately then connected together with a conducting medium. Distributed-element circuits are built by forming the medium itself into specific patterns. A major advantage of distributed-element circuits is that they can be produced cheaply as a <abbr title="printed circuit board"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" target="_blank"><i>PCB</i></a></abbr> for consumer products, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television" target="_blank">satellite television</a>. They are also made in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable" target="_blank">coaxial</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide_(electromagnetism)" target="_blank">waveguide</a> formats for applications such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" target="_blank">radar</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_communication" target="_blank">satellite communication</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_link" target="_blank">microwave links</a>.

	A phenomenon commonly used in distributed-element circuits is that a length of transmission line can be made to behave as a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonator" target="_blank">resonator</a></em>. Distributed-element components which do this include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stub_(electronics)" target="_blank">stubs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(physics)" target="_blank">coupled lines</a>, and cascaded lines. Circuits built from these components include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed-element_filter" target="_blank">filters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_dividers_and_directional_couplers" target="_blank">power dividers</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_dividers_and_directional_couplers" target="_blank"> directional couplers</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulator" target="_blank">circulators</a>.

	Distributed-element circuits were studied during the 1920s and 1930s but did not become important until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World War II" target="_blank">World War II</a>, when they were used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" target="_blank">radar</a>. After the war their use was limited to military, space, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcasting" target="_blank">broadcasting</a> infrastructure, but improvements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science" target="_blank">materials science</a> in the field soon led to broader applications. They can now be found in domestic products such as satellite dishes and mobile phones.
